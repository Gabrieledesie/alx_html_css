# Headphones Landing Page ðŸŽ§

This is a fully responsive web page built from scratch using only **HTML and CSS** â€” no frameworks, no JavaScript.

##  Project Objective

This project was built as part of the ALX Frontend Curriculum to demonstrate:
- Understanding of HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout principles
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile (breakpoint: 480px)
- Accessibility and user interaction basics

##  Design Reference

The layout is based on a Figma design by **Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer)**.  
You can find the original Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/7U5l9q6G6zBDEBP63Qprvd/Headphones?type=design&node-id=0-1).

##  Responsive Design

It uses media queries in the CSS file to optimize layout for mobile devices.
